- All assignments should be organized into folders where the name of the folder is the same as the gradescope assignment.
- All solutions codes should be name `FUNCTION_soln.m`, where `FUNCTION` is replaced with the name of the function.
    - Place the solution code into the respect HW folder.
- If additional files should be added to the active directory (ie. for dir()), create a folder called 'dir' and place additional files inside.
